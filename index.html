      <h1 tabindex="2">Introduction</h1>
      <p tabindex="4">User experience is a crucial part of web development and also the success of a website could very
        much be determined by user experience. When considering user experience we must consider all those who browse
        our website—inclusiveness for all, not just the users who don’t have conditions. If you think for a moment that
        the user base is too small to cater to then think again. According to the CDC, 61 million adults in the United
        States live with disabilities. That is 1 in 4 adult Americans that could potentially be having a terrible user
        experience if your website is not up to date with standard web accessibilities. Catering to those with
        disabilities is obviously the right thing to do but can also benefit users of all conditions as well. People
        without disabilities can also be temporarily handicapped for incidental reasons. For example, ear infections
        happen and during that stage, they can benefit from transcripts and captions on audio and videos. Temporary arm
        injuries can occur as well and this group would be glad to have a website with easy navigation and speech input.
        These are just a few of many examples of how all users can benefit from web accessibility.

      <h3 tabindex="5">Tools for accessibility</h3>
      <p tabindex="6">Tools are available to help developers make their sites more accessible to people with disabilities. 
        Browsers play an essential role in web accessibility. The challenge is to create a website and software that meets various users' needs, preferences, and situations. 
        Web accessibility can also benefit those not disabled, particularly those who have a temporary disability such as a broken arm, aging, etc. 
      </p>

      <p tabindex="6">
        The accessibility testing tool you should use is determined by various factors, including the needs of your site and your budget. 
        for our project we used NVDA for screen reading and Accessibility Insights for Web for another accessibility testing like keyboard focus, header readability, color intensity, etc.
      </p>
      <h3 tabindex="5">Advantages of Accessibility</h3>
      <img src="" alt="" />
      <p tabindex="6">
The most common misconception about web accessibility is that it only benefits people with disabilities. The benefits of web accessibility, include:
Accessible content broadens your target audience, opening up new revenue opportunities.
<ul>
 <li>Organizations that actively pursue accessibility are better equipped to handle claims and avoid costly violations.</li>
<li>Providing page titles, semantic heading structure, alternative text for images, and transcripts for audiovisual files increases your content's discoverability by search engines.</li>
<li>According to research, UI/UX accessibility enhancements benefit people without disabilities.</li>
<li>Avoiding discrimination and legal complaints</li>
<li>All of these are significant benefits for an organization.</li>
</ul>
      </p>

      <h3 tabindex="5">Disadvantages of Accessibility</h3>
      <img src="" alt="" />
      <p tabindex="6">
<ul>
 
<li>The main disadvantage of making websites accessible is the high cost of modifying a website.</li>
<li>Third-party libraries may not support accessibility, and overriding the actual behavior may be difficult. 
  To use accessibility, we may have to abandon the library, which is time-consuming and requires hard coding from scratch.</li>
</ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, one in four adults in the United States lives with disabilities. This will restrict the number of users
         for a website by 25%. Making sure the website is accessible and catered to everyone with people with disabilities will
          increase the website traffic.  Getting the websites accessible to disabled individuals could cost anywhere from $3,000
           to $50,000. Although it is expensive, this could be easily offset by the increase in website traffic by up to 25%. 
           The overall outcome will be a win-win for both the company and the individuals with a disability.
